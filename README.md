# hello-quil

A Quil sketch designed to replicate the demo [5.17: Introduction to Matter.js - The Nature of Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urR596FsU68) using ClojureScript.

A discussion on it is available on my blog, starting with the post at https://bunkham.com/matter-patience-adventures-quil-clojurescript-matter-js/

## Usage

Run `lein compile` command and open `index.html` in your browser.

For interactive development run `lein figwheel` command. This command will be recompiling cljs to js each time you modify `core.cljs` and you can see result immediately on the page servered at `http://localhost:3449`.
